Keccak
======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ctz/keccak.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ctz/keccak)

This is a pure python keccak implementation that I wrote for educational purposes.
It is not optimised, nor especially well documented.  But it does pass all the
test vectors, and is moderately readable.

It has a hashlib-compatible interface at the top-level.

Important!
----------


~While Keccak eventually became SHA3, it underwent some incompatible changes in the process.
Therefore, this library is not compatible with SHA3.~

This is no longer correct, the library now contains SHA3 primitives as well, using the SHA 
padding instead of Keccak.
